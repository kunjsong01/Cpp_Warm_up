# Cpp_Warm_up

Mini roadmap for C++ review: 
--------

1. C++ review: 
--------

    * Review on C++ concepts, template, memory management, OOP behaviour (friend, inheritance, composition, constructor/destructor calling order .etc).
        ** See basic_review_notes.md

    * Review on STL, including container, pairs, iterators, vectors, set and map. Using iterator to loop through container.  
        ** See stl_review_notes.md

    There are some experiment programs in *brush_up* folder which could help one to understand some common behaviours, e.g.: 
        * Interactions between Friend/Derived Friend and Base/Derived Base. 
        * Mixed usage of class and function tempalte.
        * ...etc

2. The *remaining_question* folder has three exercises: 
--------
    * bit extraction
        ** Two methods: One is primitive function using mask, and the other one is implemneted using C++ STL bitset object.
    * string reverse
        ** Two methods: One is primitive function using purely pointers, and the other one is implemented using C++ string object and reverse iterators.
    * Selective Round-Robin scheduling:
        ** Just a primitive method demonstrating the algorithm here.
        ** TO-DO: presumably replace the array using bitset, and use, again, iterators.

3. Study basic usage of gdb watchpoint.  
--------
